# Words-With-Friends-Tile-Counter
This program uses array lists to keep track of the remaining tiles in a game of Words With Friends

This program is simple to use. Simply enter each word played, one at a time. 
Importantly, do NOT be redundant with entered letters. For example, if you play the word "foo" horizontally, 
and then play the word "oblong" vertically, starting from one of the "o"'s in "foo," you would NOT enter 
the word "oblong" into the program; you would instead enter "blong."
