# Words-With-Friends-Tile-Counter
This program takes as input a word played in a game of Words With Friends and then prints a bank of the remaining tiles.

Note: I made this after my introductory computer science course.  
My next two CS classes are 1) object oriented programming and 2) abstraction and data structures.  

This program is fun and simple to use. Simply enter each word played from your Words With Friends game, one at a time.  
Importantly, do NOT be redundant with entered letters. For example, if you play the word "foo" horizontally, and then play the word "oblong" vertically, starting from one of the "o"'s in "foo," you would NOT enter the word "oblong" into the program; instead, you would enter "blong."
