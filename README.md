# Words-With-Friends-Tile-Counter
This program uses array lists to keep track of the remaining tiles in a game of Words With Friends

Note: I made this after my introductory computer science course. Tips on how to improve would be appreciated.
I look forward to seeing my programming skill safter my next two CS classes: 1) object oriented programming and 2) data structures. 

This program is fun and simple to use. Simply enter each word played from your Words With Friends game, one at a time. 
Importantly, do NOT be redundant with entered letters. For example, if you play the word "foo" horizontally, 
and then play the word "oblong" vertically, starting from one of the "o"'s in "foo," you would NOT enter 
the word "oblong" into the program; you would instead enter "blong."
